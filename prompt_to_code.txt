Prompt:
"Generate PLC Structured Text code for a water tank system. Start pump when tank level is below 30% and stop when above 80%, but only operate from 10 PM to 6 AM. Stop pump and trigger overflow alarm if tank exceeds 95%. Raise low flow alarm if flow is less than 10 L/min for over 5 minutes. Include a maintenance mode to disable all pump activity."

Expected Output:
IF NOT MaintenanceMode THEN
    IF (CurrentHour >= 22) OR (CurrentHour < 6) THEN
        IF TankLevel < 30 THEN
            Pump := TRUE;
        ELSIF TankLevel > 80 THEN
            Pump := FALSE;
        END_IF;
    ELSE
        Pump := FALSE;
    END_IF;
ELSE
    Pump := FALSE;
END_IF;

IF TankLevel > 95 THEN
    Pump := FALSE;
    OverflowAlarm := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF FlowRate < 10 THEN
    LowFlowTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#5m);
ELSE
    LowFlowTimer(IN := FALSE);
END_IF;

IF LowFlowTimer.Q THEN
    LowFlowAlarm := TRUE;
END_IF;
